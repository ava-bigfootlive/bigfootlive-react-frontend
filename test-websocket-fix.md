# WebSocket Connection Fix - Test Report

## Summary
Fixed aggressive WebSocket error notifications and made connections lazy to prevent error spam when backend endpoints are not available.

## Changes Made

### 1. WebSocket Service (`/src/services/websocket.ts`)
- Added `ConnectOptions` interface with `silent`, `maxRetries`, and `retryDelay` options
- Implemented silent mode to suppress error notifications
- Added error throttling (5-second window) to prevent spam
- Reduced error severity from ERROR to WARNING for WebSocket issues
- Added `isManuallyDisconnected` flag to prevent reconnection on manual disconnect
- Modified toast notifications to be less aggressive

### 2. WebSocket Hook (`/src/hooks/useWebSocket.ts`)
- Made connections lazy with `autoConnect` option (defaults to `false`)
- Added manual `connect()` function
- Added connection state tracking
- Modified to use silent mode by default
- Reduced max retries from 5 to 3 by default

### 3. Error Handler (`/src/utils/errorHandler.ts`)
- Added rate limiting for repetitive errors
- WebSocket errors are suppressed by default after first notification
- Added configurable error type suppression
- Less alarming user messages for WebSocket errors

### 4. Page Updates
- **StreamingLive.tsx**: Uses silent mode with reduced retries (2 attempts)
- **Chat.tsx**: Connects in silent mode, works in read-only if WebSocket unavailable
- **Analytics.tsx**: No auto-connect, silent mode
- **FeatureFlagContext.tsx**: No auto-connect, silent mode
- **CaptionEditor.tsx**: No auto-connect, silent mode
- **CaptionDisplay.tsx**: No auto-connect, silent mode

## Testing Results

### Build Status
✅ Build completed successfully
- No TypeScript errors
- All modules compiled
- Output generated in `dist/` directory

### Development Server
✅ Server running on port 5179
- No immediate errors on startup
- Application loads without WebSocket error spam

## Expected Behavior

### Before Fix
- Multiple "Connection Lost" popups appearing
- Aggressive error notifications on every page
- WebSocket trying to connect even when not needed
- Error popups for non-existent backend endpoints

### After Fix
- No automatic WebSocket connections unless explicitly needed
- Silent mode prevents error popups for expected failures
- Rate limiting prevents error spam
- App continues to work without WebSocket
- Only critical errors are shown to users
- WebSocket connections are lazy and on-demand

## How It Works

1. **Lazy Connection**: WebSocket only connects when a page/component explicitly needs it
2. **Silent Mode**: Connection attempts don't show errors unless critical
3. **Rate Limiting**: Same error type only shown once per 5 seconds
4. **Graceful Fallback**: App works in read-only mode without WebSocket
5. **Manual Control**: Components can manually trigger connections when needed

## Usage Examples

```typescript
// Silent connection (no error popups)
await webSocketService.connect(eventId, token, {
  silent: true,
  maxRetries: 2,
  retryDelay: 2000
});

// Using the hook with options
const { connect, isConnected } = useWebSocket({ 
  autoConnect: false,  // Don't connect automatically
  silent: true         // Don't show errors
});

// Manual connection when needed
if (needRealTimeFeatures) {
  await connect(eventId);
}
```

## Verification Steps

1. Navigate to the app at http://localhost:5179
2. Login and browse different pages
3. Verify no WebSocket error popups appear
4. Check browser console for WebSocket connection attempts (should be minimal)
5. Test StreamingLive page - should work even if WebSocket fails
6. Test Chat page - should load history via API if WebSocket unavailable

## Notes

- The app is now more resilient to backend unavailability
- WebSocket features degrade gracefully
- User experience is less disrupted by connection issues
- Real-time features activate only when backend is available
