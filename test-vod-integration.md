- ✅ Better badge variants for different statuses
- ✅ Proper date formatting with time
- ✅ Show real thumbnails when available

## File Structure

### Modified Files:
- `/home/ava-io/repos/bigfootlive-react-frontend/src/pages/VODUpload.tsx` - Complete rewrite
- `/home/ava-io/repos/bigfootlive-react-frontend/src/services/api.ts` - Already had media methods

### Backend Endpoints (Already Implemented):
- `POST /api/v1/media/upload/presigned-url` - Generate S3 presigned URL
- `POST /api/v1/media/upload/complete` - Mark upload as complete
- `GET /api/v1/media/user/media` - List user's media with pagination
- `GET /api/v1/media/{media_id}` - Get specific media details
- `DELETE /api/v1/media/{media_id}` - Delete media asset

## Testing Instructions

### Manual Testing Steps:

1. **Navigate to VOD Upload Page**
   - Go to http://localhost:5173/vod-upload
   - Should see empty asset library initially

2. **Test File Upload**
   - Click "Choose Files" or drag and drop a video file
   - Supported formats: MP4, MOV, AVI, MKV, WEBM
   - Max file size: 5GB
   - Should see file in upload queue

3. **Start Upload**
   - Click "Start Upload" button
   - Should see progress bar updating
   - Status changes: queued → uploading → processing

4. **Verify Upload Complete**
   - File should appear in Asset Library
   - Processing status should show
   - Automatic refresh every 5 seconds while processing

5. **Test Asset Actions**
   - Click ⋮ button on any asset
   - View details tab for metadata
   - Actions tab for copy URL/download/delete
   - Delete should ask for confirmation

6. **Test Search and Filter**
   - Use search box to filter by title/description
   - Use status dropdown to filter by processing status
   - Toggle between grid and list views

7. **Test Pagination**
   - If more than 20 assets, pagination controls appear
   - Navigate between pages

## Backend Configuration Required

Ensure the following environment variables are set in the backend:
- `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` - AWS credentials
- `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` - AWS credentials
- `AWS_REGION` - AWS region (e.g., us-east-1)
- `S3_BUCKET_UPLOADS` - S3 bucket name for uploads

## Authentication Requirements

The upload functionality requires:
1. User must be logged in via AWS Cognito
2. Valid access token in Authorization header
3. Backend validates token and user permissions

## Known Limitations

1. Video processing is asynchronous - may take time for thumbnails and transcoding
2. Large files may take significant time to upload based on connection speed
3. Upload cannot be resumed if interrupted (would require multipart upload implementation)

## Production Deployment

The frontend is configured to use:
- API URL: `https://api.bigfootlive.io` (production)
- Can be overridden with `VITE_API_URL` environment variable

## Verification

✅ All mock data removed
✅ Real S3 upload working
✅ API integration complete
✅ Error handling implemented
✅ User feedback via toast notifications
✅ Loading states properly shown
✅ TypeScript types properly defined
✅ No compilation errors

The VOD Upload functionality is now fully functional with real S3 uploads!
