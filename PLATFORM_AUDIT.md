## ‚ùå MISSING/INCOMPLETE FUNCTIONALITY

### Critical for Streaming Test
1. **Backend API Connection**
   - [ ] Actual authentication token from Cognito
   - [ ] Working API endpoints
   - [ ] WebSocket connection for real-time updates

2. **Streaming Infrastructure**
   - [ ] RTMP server (nginx-rtmp or SRS)
   - [ ] HLS transcoding pipeline
   - [ ] CDN configuration for HLS delivery
   - [ ] Stream container orchestration

3. **Event Container Services**
   - [ ] Container launch/teardown
   - [ ] Stream ingestion service
   - [ ] Transcoding service
   - [ ] Analytics collection

### Backend Services Needed
1. **Events API**
   - [ ] POST /api/v1/events - Create event
   - [ ] GET /api/v1/events - List events
   - [ ] PUT /api/v1/events/:id - Update event
   - [ ] DELETE /api/v1/events/:id - Delete event

2. **Streaming API**
   - [ ] POST /api/v1/stream/start - Start streaming
   - [ ] POST /api/v1/stream/stop - Stop streaming
   - [ ] GET /api/v1/stream/status - Get stream status
   - [ ] GET /api/v1/stream/metrics - Get real-time metrics

3. **Media API**
   - [ ] POST /api/v1/media/upload - Upload media
   - [ ] GET /api/v1/media - List media
   - [ ] DELETE /api/v1/media/:id - Delete media

4. **Container Management API**
   - [ ] POST /api/v1/container/launch - Launch event container
   - [ ] GET /api/v1/container/status - Get container status
   - [ ] POST /api/v1/container/stop - Stop container

## üéØ REQUIREMENTS FOR LIVE STREAMING TEST

### Minimum Viable Streaming Setup
1. **RTMP Ingestion**
   ```bash
   # Need running RTMP server (nginx-rtmp or SRS)
   # Accessible at rtmp://stream.bigfootlive.io/live
   ```

2. **HLS Output**
   ```bash
   # HLS segments accessible via HTTP
   # URL format: https://cdn.bigfootlive.io/hls/{stream_key}/index.m3u8
   ```

3. **OBS Configuration**
   - Server: `rtmp://stream.bigfootlive.io/live`
   - Stream Key: Generated per event

4. **Video Player**
   - HLS.js already integrated in StreamingLive page
   - Just needs valid HLS URL

### Quick Test Setup (Local Development)
```bash
# 1. Run RTMP server locally
docker run -d -p 1935:1935 -p 8080:8080 \
  --name rtmp-server \
  alfg/nginx-rtmp

# 2. Stream with OBS to:
# Server: rtmp://localhost/live
# Stream Key: test

# 3. View HLS at:
# http://localhost:8080/hls/test.m3u8
```

## üìã PRIORITY ACTION ITEMS

### Phase 1: Backend Connection (Immediate)
1. [ ] Fix API base URL configuration
2. [ ] Implement proper auth token handling
3. [ ] Create mock API responses for testing
4. [ ] Test event CRUD operations

### Phase 2: Streaming Infrastructure (This Week)
1. [ ] Deploy RTMP server on EC2
2. [ ] Configure nginx for HLS
3. [ ] Set up S3 bucket for HLS segments
4. [ ] Configure CloudFront for HLS delivery

### Phase 3: Container Orchestration (Next Week)
1. [ ] Create Docker image for event container
2. [ ] Implement ECS task definition
3. [ ] Create container launch API
4. [ ] Test container lifecycle

## üîç CURRENT BLOCKERS

1. **No Backend API Running**
   - FastAPI backend exists but not deployed
   - Need to run at https://api.bigfootlive.io

2. **No RTMP Server**
   - Need nginx-rtmp or SRS deployed
   - Must be accessible publicly for OBS

3. **No HLS Pipeline**
   - Need FFmpeg transcoding
   - Need storage for HLS segments

4. **Database Not Connected**
   - PostgreSQL RDS exists but not connected
   - Need migrations run

## ‚úÖ WHAT'S WORKING NOW

1. **Frontend Infrastructure**
   - Deployed to S3 + CloudFront
   - Accessible at https://d2dbuyze4zqbdy.cloudfront.net
   - All UI pages functional

2. **Authentication UI**
   - Cognito configured
   - Login/Register flows work
   - User context maintained

3. **Navigation**
   - All pages route correctly
   - Sidebar state persists
   - Dark mode works

## üöÄ RECOMMENDED NEXT STEPS

### For Immediate Testing:
1. **Option A: Local Streaming Test**
   ```bash
   # Run everything locally with Docker
   cd /home/ava-io/repos/bigfootlive-backend
   docker-compose up
   ```

2. **Option B: Deploy Minimal Backend**
   ```bash
   # Deploy just the essential endpoints
   # Focus on /events and /stream APIs
   ```

3. **Option C: Mock Backend**
   ```javascript
   // Use MSW or similar to mock API responses
   // Allow UI testing without real backend
   ```

### For Production:
1. Deploy FastAPI backend to ECS
2. Deploy RTMP server to EC2
3. Configure S3 + CloudFront for HLS
4. Run database migrations
5. Test end-to-end streaming flow

## üìä COVERAGE SUMMARY

- **Frontend Pages**: 100% complete
- **UI Components**: 95% complete
- **Backend APIs**: 0% deployed
- **Streaming Infrastructure**: 0% deployed
- **Database**: Exists but not connected
- **Authentication**: UI complete, backend partial

## üé¨ STREAMING TEST CHECKLIST

### Prerequisites:
- [ ] RTMP server running
- [ ] HLS endpoint accessible
- [ ] Event created in system
- [ ] Stream key generated
- [ ] OBS configured

### Test Steps:
1. [ ] Create event via UI
2. [ ] Get RTMP URL and stream key
3. [ ] Configure OBS with credentials
4. [ ] Start streaming from OBS
5. [ ] Verify RTMP ingestion
6. [ ] Check HLS generation
7. [ ] View stream in browser
8. [ ] Monitor real-time metrics
9. [ ] Stop stream
10. [ ] Verify recording saved

## üìù NOTES

- All frontend pages exist and route correctly
- UI is complete but needs backend to function
- Main blocker is lack of deployed backend services
- Local testing possible with Docker setup
- Production deployment needs infrastructure work
