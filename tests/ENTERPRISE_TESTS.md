## CI/CD Integration

### GitHub Actions
```yaml
- name: Run Enterprise Tests
  run: |
    npm ci
    npx playwright install --with-deps
    npm run test:enterprise
  env:
    CI: true
```

### Environment Variables
```bash
# Required for tests
PLAYWRIGHT_BASE_URL=https://bigfootlive.io
TEST_USER_EMAIL=test@bigfootlive.io
TEST_USER_PASSWORD=Test123!
TEST_ADMIN_EMAIL=admin@bigfootlive.io
TEST_ADMIN_PASSWORD=Admin123!
```

## Test Data Management

### Setup Test Data
Tests use the following test accounts:
- **Regular User:** user@bigfootlive.io
- **Streamer:** streamer@bigfootlive.io  
- **Admin:** admin@bigfootlive.io
- **Host:** host@bigfootlive.io

### Cleanup
Tests include cleanup in `afterEach` and `afterAll` hooks to remove test data.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **WebRTC Tests Failing**
   - Ensure browser has camera/mic permissions
   - Check if running in headless mode (may need headed mode)

2. **Timeout Errors**
   - Increase timeout in playwright.config.ts
   - Check network latency to test environment

3. **Authentication Failures**
   - Verify test accounts exist
   - Check Cognito configuration

4. **Overlay Tests Failing**
   - Ensure test assets exist in ./test-assets/
   - Check FFmpeg installation for video processing

### Debug Commands
```bash
# Run single test with traces
npx playwright test tests/e2e/13-feature-flags.spec.ts --trace on

# Run with verbose logging
DEBUG=pw:api npx playwright test

# Record videos for all tests
npx playwright test --video on
```

## Performance Benchmarks

Expected test execution times:
- Feature Flags: ~2 minutes
- Events DataTable: ~3 minutes
- WebRTC Multi-Presenter: ~5 minutes
- Closed Captioning: ~4 minutes
- Overlays: ~4 minutes

**Total Suite:** ~18 minutes (serial), ~10 minutes (parallel)

## Test Maintenance

### Adding New Tests
1. Create test file in `tests/e2e/` with number prefix
2. Import in `enterprise-features.suite.ts`
3. Add npm script in package.json
4. Update this documentation

### Updating Selectors
- Use data-testid attributes where possible
- Avoid text-based selectors for i18n compatibility
- Keep selectors in page objects when refactoring
