```

The implementation handles:
- Processing status (queued, processing, completed, failed)
- Thumbnail URLs
- Video metadata (duration, size, qualities)
- Error states and recovery

### 6. Testing

#### Local Development
- Server running on: http://localhost:5174/
- Test pages available at:
  - `/video-test` - Video player test page
  - `/media-assets` - Media library browser
  - `/vod-upload` - Upload and preview videos

#### Sample Test Streams
1. Big Buck Bunny: `https://test-streams.mux.dev/x36xhzz/x36xhzz.m3u8`
2. Sintel: `https://bitdash-a.akamaihd.net/content/sintel/hls/playlist.m3u8`
3. Tears of Steel: `https://demo.unified-streaming.com/k8s/features/stable/video/tears-of-steel/tears-of-steel.ism/.m3u8`

### 7. Dependencies Added
- `video.js@8.23.4` - Additional video player option
- `@types/video.js@7.3.58` - TypeScript types for video.js
- `hls.js@1.6.11` - Already installed, used for HLS streaming

### 8. Build Status
✅ Build successful with no errors
- Bundle size: 1.81 MB (527 KB gzipped)
- CSS: 156 KB (22.7 KB gzipped)

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy to Production**
   - Upload build artifacts to S3
   - Invalidate CloudFront cache
   - Test with production HLS streams

2. **Future Enhancements**
