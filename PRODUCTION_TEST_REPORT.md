| WebSocket Latency | <50ms | ✅ Real-time ready |

## Known Issues & Resolutions

### 1. CORS Headers (Minor)
**Issue**: API CORS headers not fully configured for all origins  
**Impact**: Low - API still accessible  
**Resolution**: Update ALB/API Gateway CORS configuration  

### 2. Test Authentication
**Issue**: Some enterprise tests require authenticated sessions  
**Impact**: Medium - Full test suite needs auth setup  
**Resolution**: Configure test user accounts in Cognito  

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. ✅ Production is ready for live traffic
2. ⚠️ Configure CORS headers for complete cross-origin support
3. 📊 Set up monitoring dashboards for enterprise features
4. 🔐 Create dedicated test accounts for automated testing

### Next Steps
1. Run full enterprise test suite with authentication
2. Implement performance monitoring for WebRTC streams
3. Configure auto-scaling policies for high traffic
4. Set up CloudWatch alarms for critical metrics
